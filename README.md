# File-Compression-and-Decompression-Using-Huffman-Coding
This project uses Huffman coding for efficient file compression and decompression. It reduces file sizes by encoding frequent characters with shorter codes, optimizing storage and data transmission. The tool supports both compression and lossless decompression for maintaining data integrity.
